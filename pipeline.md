# BoothBoss: Development Workflow and Pipeline

## Development Environments

### Local Development Environment
- **Development**: Local machine setup for individual developers
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for testing
- **Production**: Live environment for end users

## Branching Strategy

### Main Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **develop**: Integration branch for features, primary development branch

### Supporting Branches
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Feature development
- **bugfix/[bug-name]**: Bug fixes
- **hotfix/[hotfix-name]**: Critical production fixes
- **release/[version]**: Release preparation

## Workflow Process

### 1. Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

2. Implement feature with regular commits
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement feature component"
   ```

3. Run local tests
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   ```

4. Push to remote repository
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

5. Create Pull Request (PR) to `develop`
   - Include feature description
   - Reference related issues
   - Add tests and documentation

6. Code Review Process
   - At least one approval required
   - Address feedback and make changes
   - Automated checks must pass

7. Merge to `develop` when approved
   - Squash commits for cleaner history
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### 2. Release Process
1. Create release branch from `develop`
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   ```

2. Version bump and release preparation
   ```bash
   npm version 1.0.0
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0"
   ```

3. Final testing and bug fixes on release branch
   - Only bug fixes, no new features
   - Documentation updates

4. Create PR to `main` and `develop`
   - Include release notes
   - Reference completed features/fixes

5. Tag the release in Git
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

6. Deploy to production

### 3. Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
   ```

2. Implement fix
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve critical issue"
   ```

3. Create PR to both `main` and `develop`
   - Include detailed explanation of the fix
   - Mark as high priority

4. Deploy hotfix to production immediately after approval

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
1. **Trigger**: Push to any branch or PR creation
2. **Steps**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting (ESLint/Prettier)
   - Run type checking (TypeScript)
   - Run unit tests (Jest)
   - Run integration tests
   - Generate test coverage report

### Continuous Deployment

#### Development Deployment
1. **Trigger**: Merge to `develop`
2. **Steps**:
   - Run CI checks
   - Build application
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run smoke tests

#### Production Deployment
1. **Trigger**: Merge to `main`
2. **Steps**:
   - Run CI checks
   - Build production application
   - Run database migrations
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Run smoke tests
   - Send deployment notification

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Main Workflows

#### CI Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm lint
      - run: pnpm type-check
      - run: pnpm test
```

#### Staging Deployment
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2

          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prebuilt --prod'
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Commit Message Format
Follow Conventional Commits:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or tools

Example:
```
feat(booth): add countdown timer component

Add a configurable countdown timer for photo capture with sound effects.

Closes #123
```

### Code Style and Linting
- ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- lint-staged for running linters on staged files

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Minimum test coverage: 70%

## Database Migration Strategy
- Use Prisma migrations for schema changes
- Run migrations automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Keep migration scripts in version control
- Backup database before running migrations in production

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Set up Sentry for error tracking
- Configure alerts for critical errors
- Monitor deployment status
- Track performance metrics

## Documentation Requirements
- README with setup instructions
- Code comments for complex logic
- API documentation with examples
- User documentation for features
